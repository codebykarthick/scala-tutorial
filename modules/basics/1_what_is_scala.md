## What is Scala?
Yet another programming language, but is built with reliability and scalability in mind, particularly for handling large volume of data. It is also designed to address criticisms of Java and directly compiles using JDK into bytecode and interoperable with Java.

<!-- TOC --><a name="why-scala"></a>
## Why Scala?
Scala has a lot of advantages over Java including but not limited to
* Type inference
* First Class functions
* Closures
* Can reuse java libraries and tools
* No performance penalty

## How does it work?
Like it is mentioned before, Scala compiles down to bytecode (just like kotlin does) and therefore works with any standard JVM.

## REPL Environment
To access the REPL environment of Scala run 
```
$ sbt console

scala>
```

This will allow 1 line expressions to be executed. Try out some basic arithmetic expressions here and proceed when you are ready.
