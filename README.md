# scala-tutorial
Simple markdown workbook for step by step Scala tutorial

## Introduction
I use this repo as a means to track my own progress with Scala used in Data Science, particularly in Big Data, in simple byte-sized pieces so that it is easy to learn a new programming language. This assumes that one already knows some other programming language and the basics of development, so lot of details will be glossed over. This is loosely based on the Scala school hosted by Twitter.

Every subsequent module covers more about the language in depth.

So please start [here.](./modules/basics/1_what_is_scala.md)

## Website
I host a small blog with a writeup and other news at [my github pages](https://codebykarthick.github.io), if you are interested. It also has my contact details, should you need to contact for suggestions.
